# joke-robot
A robot that tells jokes using a Speech-to-Text API and a Joke API. This was good practice for building a tool allows two APIs to work with one another; sending data from the Joke API to the Speech-to-Text API was a little difficult to figure out, but I'm glad I got it to work. I did not design the robot but simply pulled it from GIPHY.
